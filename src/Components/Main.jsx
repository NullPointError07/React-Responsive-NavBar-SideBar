          Bangladesh is a very small country with huge population. It is a
          medium-developed country in South Asia. We have a very good and
          progressing economy. It has an area of 147,570 square kilometers. But
          it has a population of 164 million. That is huge than the area.

          But it is still a very beautiful and peaceful country. People of
          Bangladesh are so friendly with each other. This country has a
          glorious history of independence. We got independence from Pakistan in
          1971 after nine mothersâ€™ blood-shedding war. More than 3 million
          Bangladeshi sacrificed their life in that genocide.

          But still, we were able to get our independence. After independence,
          the newly born country faced lots of hard times and struggles. But it
          rises very well. Now Bangladesh is one of the best countries to live
          in South Asia. There are so many beautiful spots to see in this
          country.
